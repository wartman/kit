Kit

Basic stuff I often find myself using.

----------

Kit is somewhat similar to Tink or Thx, but with one additional goal: the only package other Kit modules are allowed to rely on is this root kit module (and on `kit.spec` for testing). Kit is also much less ambitious, in part because I am just not as good at programming.
